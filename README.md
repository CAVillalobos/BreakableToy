# Implementation instructions
This repository contains both sides of a web application that need to be deployed together.
Open 2 terminals, acces each one of the main folders, install the modules for each one and start the servers.
For the backend

    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start
    
For the frontend

    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
Now the application should be accesible. Now you have to go to [your localhost](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.
